this is arduArm specification 



data transmitt protocol from pc to arduino:


when arduino is in boot mode (8 pin is down) and is conected to pc with compiling an loading software,
arduino send one byte(85) to the com port(uart)(witch is transfered to usb).Then arduino is waiting for lenght(lng.) of programm 
to erase eeprom(or flash),this operation takes some time, so we ned to wait 10+(lng.*2)ms.
Eeprom has 1024 bytes.Due that we need to transfer uint16_t(lenght),but arduino can recive only uint8_t.
So we divide uint16_t to two uint8_t and send it separatley.

After that arduino is waiting for recivingthe data (with lng. bytes).
After compliting reciving arduino needs to be rebooted in normal mode to interpritate the programm.
